# About-myself
1st repository that I created using GitHub

Jackson Henry
Baylor University Applied Mathematics Graduate

I have experience using C++, MatLab, Mathematica, and STATA in school. 
I am hoping to further my programming experiences. 
Using CodeAcademy, I have taught myself Python, JavaScript and SQL. 
Since Git is a good code storage system and many programmers use it, I am now trying to teach myself Git.
